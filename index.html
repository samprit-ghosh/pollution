  across different countries. As a result of this, many attempts are made by countries to develop agreements that are signed by        
  multiple governments to prevent damage or manage the impacts of human activity on natural resources.This can include agreements that impact factors such as climate, oceans,
  rivers and air pollution. These international environmental agreements are sometimes legally binding documents that have legal implications when they are not followed and, at 
  other times, are more agreements in principle or are for use as codes of conduct. These agreements have a long history 
  with some multinational agreements being in place from as early as 1910 in Europe, America and Africa.

<h1>Air Pollution</h1>
<p align="left"> 
Air pollution refers to the release of pollutants into the air—pollutants which are detrimental to human health and the planet as 
a whole. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), each year air pollution is responsible for nearlyseven million deaths 
around the globe. Nine out of ten human beings currently breathe air that exceeds the WHO’s guideline limits for pollutants, with 
those living in low- and middle-income countries suffering the most. In the United States, the Clean Air Act,established in 1970, 
authorizes the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to safeguard public health by regulating the emissionsof these harmful air
pollutants. </p>
<p>
“Most air pollution comes from energy use and production,” says John Walke, director of the Clean Air Project, part of the Climate and
Clean Energy program at NRDC. “Burning fossil fuels releases gases and chemicals into the air.” And in an especially destructive feedback 
loop, air pollution not only contributes to climate change but is also exacerbated by it. “Air pollution in the form of carbon dioxide and 
methane raises the earth’s temperature,” Walke says. “Another type of air pollution, smog, is then worsened by that increased heat, forming 
when the weather is warmer and there’s more ultraviolet radiation.” Climate change also increases the production of allergenic air pollutants,
including mold (thanks to damp conditions caused by extreme weather and increased flooding) and pollen (due to a longer pollen season).
</p>
<h1>Water Pollution</h1>
<p align="left"> Water pollution occurs when harmful substances—often chemicals or microorganisms—contaminate a stream, river, lake, ocean,
aquifer, or other body of water, degrading water quality and rendering it toxic to humans or the environment .
</p>
<p>
Water is uniquely vulnerable to pollution. Known as a “universal solvent,” water is able to dissolve more substances than any other liquid
on earth. It’s the reason we have Kool-Aid and brilliant blue waterfalls. It’s also why water is so easily polluted. Toxic substances from
farms, towns, and factories readily dissolve into and mix with it, causing water pollution.

<h1>Land Pollution</h1>

<p align="left"> 
Land pollution, the deposition of solid or liquid waste materials on land or underground in a manner that can contaminate the soil and 
groundwater, threaten public health, and cause unsightly conditions and nuisances.

The waste materials that cause land pollution are broadly classified as municipal solid waste (MSW, also called municipal refuse), 
construction and demolition (C&D) waste or debris, and hazardous waste. MSW includes nonhazardous garbage, rubbish, and trash from homes,
institutions (e.g., schools), commercial establishments, and industrial facilities. Garbage contains moist and decomposable (biodegra-
dable) food wastes (e.g., meat and vegetable scraps); rubbish comprises mostly dry materials such as paper, glass, textiles, and plastic-

objects; and trash includes bulky waste materials and objects that are not collected routinely for disposal (e.g., discarded mattresses,
appliances, pieces of furniture). C&D waste (or debris) includes wood and metal objects, wallboard, concrete rubble, asphalt, and other
inert materials produced when structures are built, renovated, or demolished. Hazardous wastes include harmful and dangerous substances
generated primarily as liquids but also as solids, sludges, or gases by various chemical manufacturing companies, petroleum refineries,
paper mills, smelters, machine shops, dry cleaners, automobile repair shops, and many other industries or commercial facilities. In 
addition to improper disposal of MSW, C&D waste, and hazardous waste, contaminated effluent from subsurface sewage disposal (e.g., from 
septic tanks) can also be a cause of land pollution.
</p>
<h1>Noise Pollution</h1>
<p align="left">
Noise pollution or noise disturbance is the excessive noise that may harm the activity or balance of human or animal life. The source of
most outdoor noise worldwide is mainly caused by machines and transportation systems, motor vehicles, aircraft, and trains. Noise pollut-
ion affects both health and behavior.

Noise pollution takes place when there is either excessive amount of noise or an unpleasant sound that causes temporary disruption in the
balance. This definition is usually applicable to sounds or noises that are unnatural in either their volume or their production. Our 
environment is such that it has become difficult to escape noise. Even electrical appliances at home have a constant hum or beeping sound. 
By and large, lack of urban planning increases the exposure to unwanted sounds.
